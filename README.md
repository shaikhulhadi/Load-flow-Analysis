# Load-flow-Analysis
This Matlab program perform load flow analysis of power system based on Gauss Seidel algorithm. 

This software will analyzed required power source insertion at certain terminal by analyzing all the available power and load at different terminal in whole power bus system for stability. This will be highly useful for insertion of new power source in the grid and anylize its effect at other load or sources. This software could analyze maximum 100 bus power system.
